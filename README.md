# WebScraping_And_WebApp_On_Law_Enforcement_Line_Of_Duty_Deaths_USA

Note -> The analysis was done on first version of dataset which is "police_deaths_in_america". New version is updated every month.

New Version Features -> With the new web scrapper I have upgraded dataset with more information.

                        1) The new dataset version is "police_deaths_USA_v6" and "k9_deaths_USA_v6" Which is in "After Major Update Versions" folder (For all versions please check out this link :-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayureshkoli/police-deaths-in-usa-from-1791-to-2022)
                        2) Splitted the dataset into 2 different datasets 1 for Human Unit and other for K9 Unit.
                        3) Check out the new web scrapper code in this file "final_scrapper_program_with_comments".
                        4) Also added the correction file which is needed to adjust some data points from K9 dataset.
                        5) Extended data of Human Unit dataset to 13 Features.
                        6) Extended data of K9 Unit dataset to 14 Features.

Data Analyst: Mayuresh Koli

I am going to scrape all the police deaths data which occured in USA from 1791 to Present including both Human Unit and K9 Unit which are registered on this website https://www.odmp.org/

This data then can be used for data analytics.

I have chosen Jupyter Notebook over VS Code because i think i can express my program here more comfortably than VS Code.

I have written all the necessary comments and tried to make this program beginner friendly as much as possible.

Feel free to check the program and I hope you will be able to understand this program and try to practice or use it as a reference.

The dataset that i have collected in this project you can find it on my Kaggle as well as Github Profile.

Tip :- If you want to understand the program well I can only say that separate the program into sections and run it individually and also you can do some debugging on it.

For any doubts and query you can connect with me on Linkedin or Email me.
